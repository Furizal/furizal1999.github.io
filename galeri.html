                <p>
                    Parents are my greatest treasure. A treasure that I will never meet again out there. Love them not only as my duty, but also
                    my needs. None of my steps are accurate without his pleasure. And none of my blessing decisions without his blessing.
                    The opportunity to meet face to face today with him is a wonderful blessing from Allah.

                    IT FUN DAY is an activity that is coordinated by the Information Technology Student Association of Riau Islamic University (HIMATIF). 
                    This activity is regularly held every year. And at this event, precisely in 2019 I was in charge of the event section.
                    This activity is specifically for Informatics Engineering Students. This activity was made to further make new students of Informatics Engineering more able
                    familiar and get to know his seniors. With this activity, it is expected to form a sense of kinship between students in Informatics Engineering

                    The semester break is the time where we have the chance to calm our minds from the piling lectures / schools.
                    In this picture, I refract it to one of the natural tourist locations in Rokan Hulu, Riau. Namely Aek Mertua Waterfall or often known as AM.
                    Maybe some of you have visited it. I hope we can both use the vacation time as well as possible.

                <p>
                    Sometimes I will also feel bored with days that are always scheduled with assignments. But that does not mean complaining with tasks that accumulate.
                    But we also need time to give space to the brain to return to thinking clearly. Well, here I am trying to let go of saturation
                    by hanging out in the cafe without thinking about the piled up tasks. But that does not mean the task is ignored huh ... hehehe ..
                    Maybe friends can also do it like what I did .. after that remember the task again huh ... hehehe ...

                <p>
                    For those who live in Riau, definitely feel bored with the smoke disaster that occurred in 2019. The fire is predicted because of the action or nasty
                    a group of people made students in Indonesia move to the streets to urge the government to thoroughly investigate the forest fire case. Well, this is
                    momment where the university took to the streets leading to the office of the People's Representative Council of Riau Province by directly entering the purification meeting room.

                <p>
                    Marriage is something that is common in humans. Because it is a human need in matters of sex and worship.
                    And in the wedding itself often held a photo together with the bride to capture the moment of the wedding itself.
                    and this photo is a photo of my cousin's wedding reception in 2019. Her name is ANILA FITRI.
                    There were 6 people photographed, namely my younger brother, my father, two brides, my mother and me.

                    There are times when we have fun hanging out with friends. This photo is a memory when gathering with my group of friends in a caf√©
                    in Pekanbaru. Inside there is laughter as a lonely pad. And the laughter will always be remembered by immortalizing this photo.

                <p>
                    Berlibur adalah salah satu penghibur diri dikala sedih, galau, sepi dan gundah. Tidak sedikit orang yang berlibur setelah melakukan pekerjaan menjenuhkan.
                    Baik itu pekerja pada umumnya maupun pelajar atau mahasiswa pada umumnya yang sibuk tentang tugas. Dengan melihat sesuai yang baru, indah dan menarik di luar,
                    maka secara tidak langsung pikiran akan menjadi lebih segar dari biasa nya.
                    Di foto ini terlihat dan beserta dua orang kakak saya berkunjung ke stadiun utama Pekanbaru, Riau.

                    Student Service Camp or often called KBM is an activity that is held annually by the UIM HIMATIVE (Informatics Engineering Student Association).
                    This activity I am positive for students. With this activity students are expected to be more independent and more able to recognize their seniors.
                    And also with this activity can be realized good family relations between individuals.

                    Organizational Basic Training or often called LDO is an activity that trains students' leadership or organization.
                    In this activity many positive lessons can be quoted by students as a provision for shelter in the organization world.
                    This photo is a reminder of 2018 activities of the Islamic Engineering Study Forum (FSI Teknik) in 2018.
